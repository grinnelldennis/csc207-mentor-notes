Are read/write permissions the same for private, public and protected methods?
Yes. 

Why do we set fields to private if we need to have setters/getters anyway?
Setterse and getters hide the abstracts the implementation within the class so that the user doesn't have to deal with it. 

When do we mark a class abstract?
